# CS223TERM-PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to build a simplified single-cycle processor (Single-cycle processor: an instruction is fetched from memory, it is executed, and the results are stored all in a single clock cycle.) on Basys 3 board that would be capable of performing several types of instructions. The processor you will design will perform several functions depending on the 16- bit instructions on 8-bit data. Your design should include instruction memory, data memory, a register file and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The instruction memory should be a read-only memory. Data memory should be able to hold 16x8-bit data. Instructions to be executed should be either picked from the instruction memory, or from the switches on Basys3. Depending on the instruction, processor should do addition, load/store, and branch operations.
